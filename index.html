      <h2>About VKG</h2>
      <p>The Chinese team VKG, representing the Asia Pacific South region, was not originally a favorite to win the championship before the game. They fought steadily in nine games in today's final. Although they were defeated by Gen.G in the eighth game, which was a bit thrilling, they successfully defeated Wolves Esports in the last game. With a total score of 96 points, they won the championship surrounded by strong opponents such as Ninjas in Pyjamas who were favored before the game, and took home a prize of 600,000 US dollars.</p>
